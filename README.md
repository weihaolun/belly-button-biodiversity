# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Background

Rosa is a biological researcher in a permanent microbiology laboratory. She is interested in bacterial species that have ability to synthesize proteins that tastes like beef, her lab has partnered with Improbable Beef, a food startup research candidate species lab across the country have had success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungi and microorganisms, found on plant roots, however Improbable Beef is still searching for the elusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste. 

Rosa has a hypothesis that there’s a microorganism that can supply the next best taste, and she believes it can be found from human body.  Rosa hypothesizes that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef may be found in the belly button, or at least in someone’s belly button to test our hypothesis. Rosa has sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize out belly buttons, each person’s identity is anonymous, they’ve instead been assigned an ID number. 

For this project, I’ve been helping Rosa to build a dashboard that both our research participants and fellow researchers can access those who participated in the study will be able to visits a website and select their ID numbers to see which bacterial species live in the navels. 


## The Dashboard [(Click Here)](https://weihaolun.github.io/belly-button-biodiversity/)

The left-hand side on the dashboard appears a panel for users to select the sample number, and the Demographic Info will appear accordingly. 

There are three data charts on the dashboard to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer:

1.	A bar chart to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly button.
2.	A bubble chart to visualize the bacteria cultures per sample.
3.	A gauge chart to show the washing frequency (scrubs per week) per sample.


## Dashboard Customization

1.	Added a Jumbotron image.

2.	Customized text-font color:
    -	Jumbotron to white
    -	Test ID Selection Panel to white
    -	Demographic Info table to white

3.	Adjusted all chart’s title text to be bold

4.	Background color:
    -	Website background color to light grey
    -	Selection Panel background color to blue
    -	Demographic Info table to blue/green
    -	Bar Chart marker to green
    -	All charts’ paper_bgcolor and plot_bgcolor to match website background color (light grey.

5.	Mobile Responsive
